# Conways's Game of Life in JavaScript

This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in JavaScript created as an exercise in behaviour-driven JavaScript development. Created by [@basicallydan](https://github.com/basicallydan).

## The Game

Check out the game of life in a lovely canvas view by visiting index.html, or simply going to the repo's GitHub Pages Page: https://conwaysgame.github.io/javascript/ - this may one day be made more attractive.

## Tests

Jasmine is included under `lib` so you just need to open SpecRunner.html in a web browser to see the outcome of the unit tests.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, that's great and I encourage it - I do, however, also encourage reading the [contributing doc](https://github.com/conwaysgame/javascript/blob/master/contributing.md) first. The golden rule for contributing is that **you ensure that the tests are still passing before you make a pull request.**
